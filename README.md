# DSA and CP Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CP (Competitive Programming) practice repository!

## Overview

This repository contains my practice files for:
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Includes implementations and problems related to various data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **Competitive Programming**: Contains solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, and more.
- 

Feel free to browse through the files, clone the repository, and use the code for learning and practice. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
