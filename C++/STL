c++ stl consists four main things;- containers, functors , iterators and algorithms
containers are mainly - sequebntial  unordered and ordered
-vectors
-maps
-pairs 
-set 
-multimaps
-stack
-Queue
-priorityQueue

itarators:-
itarators are the indexes that points to the memory locations of the element pesent in the container 

algorithms:-
pre defined library methods that helps to perform the task in very sort lines of code instsead of writing the full algorithm step by step

-sort();
-upperbound()
-lowerBound()
-begin()
-end()
etc                 we will know more details later by implementing in code
